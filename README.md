Analysis of Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Louise wants to know how well other fundraising campaigns have done based on their launch dates. She is particularly interested in how campaigns from the theater category did (musics theater, plays, etc.) in relation to their fundraising goals.

### The results of this inquiry will allow her to determine a launch date for her own theater campaign that will allow her the greatest chance of success. Looking at fundraising goals of other theater projects will also allow her to set realistic fundraising goals.

Analysis of Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Louise wants to know how well other fundraising campaigns have done based on their launch dates. She is particularly interested in how campaigns from the theater category performed (musics theater, plays, etc.) in relation to their fundraising goals.

## In order to conduct an analysis of the outcomes of theater fundraising campaigns, I made use of pivot tables and line charts to track performance in a continuous fashion.

### When exploring outcomes of theater campaigns based on launch date, I created a pivot table with campaign outcomes for the columns and launch dates by month for the rows. For each month, the count of successful, failed, and canceled outcomes were listed. I filtered the table by year and fundraising category, specifically focusing on the "theater" category. I then created a line chart to display the trends of success and failure based on launch date.

### When exploring outcomes based on fundraising goals I created a table with several goal ranges in the first column. I then created columns with the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns that fell into those various ranges. I made another column with the sum total of all outcomes for each range which I then used, in combination with the other columns, to create new columns giving percentages of successful, failed, and canceled projects for each goal range. Finally, I created a line chart
